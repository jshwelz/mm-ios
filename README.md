# Hello Bluetooth

This is a simple swift app that demonstrates very basic bi-directional communication with an Arduino via bluetooth. It is designed to work out-of-the-box with an [Arduino 101](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101) running the `ButtonLED` example project.

You can read more about this project [on my medium post](https://medium.com/@nebsp/hello-bluetooth-a-simple-swift-app-for-communicating-with-an-arduino-bbf26e089999).  

## Setup

Simply connect a push button to pin 4 on your Arduino 101 an upload the `ButtonLED` sketch to it. While the Arduino is running, launch the `HelloBluetooth` iOS app on a device. You can then play with the push button or the button in the iOS app.
